# Final results

Right guys, so here we are. I don't know if you realize you have come a long way this week. You have learned:

(i) how to count and plot Kmers to understand genome composition (heterozygosity, genome size, repeat content)
(ii) you have assembled your genome with 2 different softwares
(iii) you have learned about purging genomes to (i) separated haplotypes or (ii) exclude retained haplotypes
(iv) you have learned how to evaluate genome quality with (i) kmers (Merqury, (ii) mapping (samtools, IGV) , (iii) general statistics and (iv) busco
(v) you have learned how to scaffold genomes with Hi-C data and SALSA2
(vi) you have heard of genome polishing and curation
(vii) you have learned how to run stand alone BLAST

Look at that? Thats is A LOT! WELL DONE!

This material will be always here for you to come back to it and consolidate your knowlegde, and you can ALWAYS email me with questions; it will be lovely to hear from you.
