### PretextView 

Just like for the IGV, every participant needs to install PretextView in its own personal computer. Follow these steps to install it in your machine:  

1. Using [this link](https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView/releases), download the latest release of the PretextView prebuilt app. Be careful to choose the file that is compatible with your operating system (*PretextView-<MacOS/Linux/Windows>.zip*).

2. Once the download is done, you just need to unzip the downloaded file. 
3. After unzipping, you will have an executable file called *PretextView.exe*, which you can double-click to open the PretextView software.
