# Assembling genomes

Right, so here we are! Letâ€™s assemble the species you have chosen. You are going to run two assemblers for Pacbio HiFi data: Hicanu and Hifiasm.

Have a look at their websites:
[Hicanu](https://github.com/marbl/canu/releases/tag/v2.1)
[Hifiasm](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm)
