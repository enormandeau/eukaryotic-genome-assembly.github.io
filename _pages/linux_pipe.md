## Background  
Every program we run in the command line has three data streams connected to it, which are:  
* STDIN (0) - It is the standard input, which is the data fed into the program  
* STDOUT (1) - It is the standard output, which is the data returned by the program  
* STDERR (2) - It is the standar error, which are error messages printed out by the program. Like the STDOUT, it's printed by default to the terminal as the command executes.
