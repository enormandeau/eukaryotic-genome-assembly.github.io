![marcela](https://github.com/eukaryotic-genome-assembly/eukaryotic-genome-assembly.github.io/blob/master/_pages/IMG_1850%20copy%202.jpeg)

Hey guys, I'm a senior bioinformatician at the Wellcome Sanger Institute working at the Darwin Tree of Life Project (DToL) assembling genomes for all eukaryotic life in Britain and Ireland. I'm passionate about evolution and biodiversity conservation. I hold a PhD in Biophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and I was a Marie Curie (MSCA grantee) postdoc for 2 years at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Germany before I moved to the Sanger. I'll bring my biologist background to help you learn genome assembly in a accessible way. Don't be afraid of computers, they are our friends! You will enjoy it!
