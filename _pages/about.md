### Marcela Uliano da Silva  

Hey guys, I'm a senior bioinformatician at the Wellcome Sanger Institute working at the Darwin Tree of Life Project (DToL) assembling genomes for all eukaryotic life in Britain and Ireland. I'm passionate about evolution and biodiversity conservation. I hold a PhD in Biophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and I was a Marie Curie (MSCA grantee) postdoc for 2 years at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Germany before I moved to the Sanger. I'll bring my biologist background to help you learn genome assembly in a accessible way. Don't be afraid of computers, they are our friends! You will enjoy it! 



### Jo√£o Gabriel Rodinho Nunes Ferreira

Hi there, I am a PhD student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), working with genomics of the golden mussel, an invasive species that has been causing a lot of trouble for South American and Asian countries. In my masters I have studied the population genetics of the same species, genetically comparing golden mussels collected from 5 different states of Brazil. I'm passionate about genomes and their power as a tool to better understand the biology of any species. I hope we can exchange some experience and by the end of week you are confident enough to start taking advantage of the whole potential of PacBio and Hi-C data for assemblying great genomes!
