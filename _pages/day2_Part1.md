## Kmer analysis: running jellyfish <a name="where-are-we?"></a> 

Go to the folder with the data you have chosen to assemble
  
```console  
ls -ltrh
```  
Do you see all your files there? Great! Now call Jellyfish:

```console  
jellyfish
``` 

Do you see the help message? Great! If not, call JoƒÅo!

Jellyfish has many steps. The first one we want to use is the count to count our genome kmers. The kmer size we are going to use is 31.
